<p>
Protozoa are unicellular, eukaryotic, heterotrophic organisms. They are either free-living or parasites. There are around 65000 species of protozoans categorised in different groups. They lack a cell wall. There are many different cell organelles, that perform various tasks performed by different organs in higher animals, e.g. mouth, anus, intestinal tract, etc.

<ul>
<li>They mostly have one membrane-bound nucleus in the cell</li>
<li>The nucleus has diffused appearance due to scattered chromatin, the vesicular nucleus contains a central body called endosome or nucleoli. Nucleoli of apicomplexans have DNA, whereas amoeboids lack DNA in their endosome</li>
<li>Ciliates have micronucleus and macronucleus</li>
<li>The plasma membrane encloses the cytoplasm and other locomotory projections like flagella, pseudopodia and cilia</li>
<li>Some of the genera have a membranous envelope called pellicle, which gives a definite shape to the cell. In some of the protozoans, epibiotic bacteria attach to the pellicle by their fimbriae</li>
<li>The cytoplasm is differentiated into outer ectoplasm and inner endoplasm, ectoplasm is transparent and endoplasm contains cell organelles</li>
